Welcome to Graphenstein
-----------------------

This is a browser-based app for exploring common graph algorithms, written in a combination of C++
compiled to WebAssembly, vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS (hence the Frankenstein reference in its name).

This project runs on a web browser as a mainly client-side application. It does, however,
require a server to run properly (running it from a localhost works fine).

The C++ code that compiles into WebAssembly is included ("graphs.cpp") for your perusal.

Thanks for checking out Graphensein -- enjoy!
